prompt: Create an upbeat, playful soundtrack for a memory match tile game. The music should have a sense of mystery and discovery, with light, twinkling sounds to represent the flipping of tiles. As the player progresses and makes matches, incorporate triumphant flourishes. The overall tone should be encouraging and fun, suitable for all ages. Include a more intense, exciting variation for when the player is close to completing the game, building anticipation. For the victory moment, compose a short, celebratory fanfare that smoothly transitions back into the main theme, allowing for seamless looping.
genres: Electronic, Chiptune, Orchestral
